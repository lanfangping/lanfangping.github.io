abstract: Policy information in computer networking today is hard to manage. This
  is in sharp contrast to relational data structured in a database that allows easy
  access. In this demonstration, we ask why cannot (or how can) turn network policies
  into relational data. Our key observation is that oftentimes a policy does not prescribe
  a single ``definite'' network state, but rather is an ``incomplete'' description
  of all the legitimate network states. Based on this idea, we adopt conditional tables
  and the usual SQL interface (a relational structure developed for incomplete database)
  as a means to represent and query sets of network states in exactly the same way
  as a single definite network snapshot. More importantly, like relational tables
  that improve data productivity and innovation, relational policies allow us to extend
  a rich set of data mediating methods to address the networking problem of coordinating
  policies in a distributed environment.
