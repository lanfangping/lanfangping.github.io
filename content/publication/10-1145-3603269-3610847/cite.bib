 abstract = {Traditional network state management focuses on packets that exercise network structures (configurations, procedures) and testify semantics (intentions), but provides little insights into how the structure actually "causes" the semantics. In response to this missed opportunity, we propose reflective networking, which features a network structure capable of altering itself with a causal connection to its semantics. Specifically, we investigate the network datalog structure and the chase, a process that transforms datalog programs by "executing" intents (semantic constraints) that are themselves expressed in datalog. To illustrate the usefulness of reflective networking, this demonstration presents a first use case: we developed an intuitive specification of routing in datalog, and employed the chase to summarize a network's routing behavior by minimizing (repeatedly transforming) the corresponding datalog program.},
