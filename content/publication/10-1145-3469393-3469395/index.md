abstract: 'BGP and its alternatives alike, struggle with distributed policy making
  in the absence of a central authority: BGP prioritizes independence of the participating
  networks (e.g., ASes), imposes zero coordination, but has to tolerate inflexible
  policies each network can express. On the other hand, BGP alternatives (source routing,
  for example), through coordination, trade independence for flexibility, but only
  achieve flexibility partially. This paper asks, to achieve flexible routing, what
  is the fitting adjustment between network independence and coordination? To answer
  this question, we propose a simple principle that the sole end to interfere with
  the flexibility of a participating network is to prevent harms — decreasing the
  level of flexibility — to others. As an instantiation of this principle, we introduce
  the concept of policy exchange that dynamically adjusts independently set policies
  on the fly, and develop a preliminary implementation with conditional table, a strong
  knowledge representation system that allows us to distribute and manipulate policies
  with the usual SQL-like operators. Our preliminary experiments on realistic network
  topology and synthetic policies are encouraging.'
