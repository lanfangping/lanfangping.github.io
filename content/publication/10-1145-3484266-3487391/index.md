abstract: 'Formal analysis has been intensively studied (e.g., deep customization
  and synergistic co-design) in the networking domain, but one assumption remains
  largely unexamined: there is a complete evaluation that expects definite knowledge
  of the task, and is expected to output a decisive result. This paper argues for
  a \"partial\" approach, a departure from the de facto, to network analysis in a
  practical environment with uncertain events and limited visibility. Specifically,
  we seek (1) loss-less modeling in which network uncertainty is explicitly handled
  without corrupting the querying capability; and (2) complete verification relative
  to the level of information available, which reaches an inconclusive result only
  when more information is needed. As a realization of this vision, we present fauré,
  a preliminary design in which a datalog extension (called fauré-log) for incomplete
  information is developed to enable loss-less modeling, and combined with static
  analysis of pure datalog to implement example relative-complete verifiers.'
